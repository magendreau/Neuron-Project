For the main file, two neurons are created and one is the firing one and 
the other is the postsynaptic one. If neuron1 spikes, its infos are written
in a file and neuron2 is updated. Each time, the membrane potential and spikes 
times are stored in two different vectors and compared to each other.
Everytime they are used they are moved to the first index and so on. 

In the cpp file, the main parts are in the update function and both test functions.
The update has three version with two commented. It verify the conditions in which
the neuron is: refractory, spiking or if its membrane potential increases but is 
not over the thresold. The two functions of testing receives each one vector with
two values to be compared. If the difference is small enough the delay ( or increment
of J) is correct.
The class contains also a function to update the state of the neuron and some getters 
and setters for all its parameters. To fill the ring buffer of the actual neuron, 
an index is used to calculate if the size of the buffer is crossed and the number of spikes
received at that time is stored. Membrane potential increases as usual adding J.
