In the hpp file, I declared a new vector testing and the clock 
(local time) of the neuron, with the corresponding getters and 
setters. 

In the cpp file, the testing vector is used to store the membrane 
potential values when the buffer is filled to be used later on in
the testing functions of unittest.

In the main part, the "testing" functions previoulsy created in the
class Neuron are commented and I created some new test functions in 
the unittest file.

In the unittest file, The vector testing declared in Neuron.hpp is 
called and I tried to sum all the value excpet the last one ( which
corresponds to the time of delay) and to see if it's zero. Then for
the last value of the vector I compare it with J to see if the delay
was respected before the membrane potential increased.
