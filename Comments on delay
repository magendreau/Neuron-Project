For this upload the main change is that I remade the idea of delay.
Instead of using indexes and variables to check if the value I put in
the buffer is still inside the buffer, I use the modulo to do it.
This make the conception easier and the writing of functions as well.
When I fill the ring buffer I create a variable (readOut) that is 
step+D modulo D+1, so it represents the box where the value should be 
after delay D resized based on the size of the buffer.
Putting directly the value at the right place, allows us not to move 
all values at each time steps still being able to tell that the neuron
should only respond when the time corresponds to that box.
In the update, the neuron reads its ring buffer at the actual time and the
value could either be 0 or a multiple of J.
