In the cpp file, the update state gains a new condition for the
spike time and to determine the state of the neuron as I got aware
of the fact that the time when a spike occured is set at zero at
the beginning by the constructor so the neuron (who started as refractory
as well) was considered to spike at time 0ms and so it when in the 
refractory period at first and did nothing for 2ms. So to get into the 
refractory state the time should be different from 0.
The function update, verifies the same conditions for the neuron and 
fills the ringBuffer of the neuron at each time, so the value is either 
a multiple of J_excitatory or 0. The parameter recep tells if the neuron 
is for reception or for firing so that only neurons that fire do the spike.
Otherwise both neurons did the spikes.
The value of the ring buffer is added to the computation of the membrane 
potential.

In unittest, the first test verifies that the membrane potential increases 
of J and so it compares in different cases to values and if the difference is 
smaller than a value defined it's correct.
The second, checks the delay. We know that neuron1 spikes at step 1925 so we update 
neuron2 from time 1925 to 1925+Delay and its membrane potential value at the end 
should be 0.1, so the amplitude.
the last two functions check if the membrane potential is calculated correctly
whith a positive (respectively) negative input.

The old versions files, contain the code from the previous conception.
