Final Program comments:
In this version I didn't change muh compared to the one with many neurons.
The main difference is that I created a class Nerwork in which I do some
things that were previously done either in the main file or in neuron.cpp.
The class Network is used to create all neurons that compose the network 
and to create random connections between them. 
So I first initialized and declared an array neurons in the main and now
it's an attribute of the class Network that has a size of 12500.
This class contains also a getter and the function instaureConnections that
was previously in neuron.cpp. This function does the same as before but 
with an extra for loop to do it for each neuron of neurons.
When I initialize neurons I put first 10000 excitatory neurons and then 
2500 inhibitory ones.

As a result, I declare a network in the main and call each function (to 
initialize and to make connections) before the while.
I had troubles with the speed of my program so instead of a for loop with
indexes I changed for a for auto declaring a variable that increases each
time to replace the index of the array, which is the neuron number/id.
